{"name":"Post Type Icons","tagline":"A simple WordPress plugin for setting icons for post types. Requires MP6 (new admin design).","body":"<img src=\"http://boyn.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/banner-1544x500.png\" style=\"max-width:100%\" alt=\"Post Type Icons Demo\" />\r\n\r\nQuickly and easily add icons to your custom post types. Built for the new dashboard design that should come out with 3.7.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Post Type Icons: Normal state demo\" src=\"http://boyn.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/screenshot-1.png\" style=\"width:250px\" />\r\n<img alt=\"Post Type Icons: Active state demo\" src=\"http://boyn.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/screenshot-2.png\" style=\"width:250px\" />\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nDoes the pushpin not describe your custom post type? Here are 361 more icons to choose from. Icons are the GPL-compatible [Font Awesome Icons](http://fontawesome.io/). This is built for the new admin design that should debut with 3.7 (you can use the [MP6 Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/) until then).\r\n\r\nThis is the same icon features that comes with [SuperCPT](http://wordpress.org/plugins/super-cpt/), but pulled out of the plugin for those crazy birds who don't use it.\r\n\r\nThis adds a function you can use to set your post type's icon:\r\n\r\n`pti_set_post_type_icon( $post_type, $icon );`\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n`pti_set_post_type_icon( 'event', 'calendar' );`\r\n\r\nYou can also set the global variable $pti_icons as an array of post type => icon names. Using the global variable is safer, since it doesn't rely on a function (you could of course call `if ( function_exists( 'pti_set_post_type_icons' ) )` to be equally safe using the function).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory\r\n2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress\r\n3. Figure out which icon you want to use. Go to Tools &rarr; Post Type Icons page for a reference.\r\n4. In your theme or a plugin, set the icons in one of the following ways:\r\n   1. Call the function `pti_set_post_type_icon( $post_type, $icon_name );`, e.g. `pti_set_post_type_icon( 'event', 'calendar' );`\r\n   2. Using the global variable `$pti_icons`, set the array key => value pair such that `'post_type' => 'icon-name'`, e.g. `$GLOBALS['pti_icons']['event'] = 'calendar';`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n### Do I have to write code/edit my theme to use this plugin?\r\n\r\nFor now, yes. The next version will come with a GUI.\r\n\r\n### Does this do anything besides add icons?\r\n\r\nNot at all! If you want more functionality, check out [SuperCPT](http://wordpress.org/plugins/super-cpt/), which helps you create custom post types, custom taxonomies, and add meta boxes.\r\n\r\n### This looks like crap\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the new admin design, you can install and activate the [MP6 Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/) to get it. If you are using the new admin design, post to the support tab with your browser/OS/WP Version details.\r\n\r\n### I set my icons and they're never going to change. Is there a way to remove the plugin overhead and make it static?\r\n\r\nSure thing! The plugin pretty much just adds CSS to the admin which get added to the document head. Move those to your theme/plugin (not your main style.css since this is the admin panel, you'll need an admin-only CSS file). You can leave the paths the same if you don't plan on uninstalling the plugin (you can still deactivate the plugin). If you want to uninstall it, you'll have to copy the fonts to your theme/plugin and change the paths in the CSS.\r\n\r\n### I don't want my client seeing the Post Type Icons page in the admin, can I remove it?\r\n\r\nYes. Add `add_filter( 'pti_plugin_show_admin_menu', '__return_false' );` in your theme/plugin.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n**Matthew Boynes**\r\n\r\n* [@senyob on Twitter](http://twitter.com/senyob)\r\n* [Github](http://github.com/mboynes)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this work except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License in the LICENSE file, or at:\r\n\r\n\t http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
